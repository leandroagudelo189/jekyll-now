Existing machine and deep learning models lack allostatic strategies. In addition, current systems offer <br>
great performance in narrow environment or applications. This means deep reinforcement learning or <br>
evolutionary strategies fail to integrate responses across multiple non-related environments. In fact, there is <br>
no viable long-term memory approach for multi-environment integration. Training these systems remains <br>
very expensive, even for approaches that mimic natural selection such as genetic algorithms.  <br>
<br>
Interestingly, biological systems have developed solutions for integrating massive tons of data with  <br>
genetically encoded responses. These responses can last many generations and can in fact be used in  <br>
different environments. There are many molecular solutions that have been shaped through thousands of <br>
years to offer better evolutionary outcomes. Some of the more impactful adaptations are <br>
comparmentalization of specific tasks, development of low entropy models and transcriptional encoding <br>
of information. <br>
  <br>
In line with this, we aim at integrating evolutionary adaptations observed in biological systems with machine <br>
and deep learning models. We believe that this scientific journey is a step closer to the generation of <br>
allostatic agents with the ability to emulate transcriptional encoding. <br>
