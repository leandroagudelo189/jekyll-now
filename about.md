### We are currently in development

Renesence labs is an educational, research and open-source organization whose primary goals are:

- Develop allostatic deep learning systems that combine both reinforcement learning and evolutionary strategies

- Develop hybrid deep learning algorithms suitable for understanding complex biological networks 

- Metabolic systems are one of the most allostatic networks by nature. We believe that borrowing the flexibility 

With the advent of deep learning, the world is changing at an increasing pace. Given this dynamism, we want to curate and document the process of learning how to learn :)

### THE FOUNDERS

### [Leandro Agudelo PhD, Head of Research]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018-05-04-Leandro-Agudelo)
Leandro is a postdoctoral associate at the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.csail.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} in [Manolis Kellis lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/compbio.html){:target="_blank"}, where he works at the intersection between metabolism, computational biology and deep learning. His skill-sets are whithin the areas of molecular metabolism and computer science. He is endlessly curious about understanding the deep underlying order within complex biological systems. Therefore, he applies machine and deep learning algorithms for pattern discovery in biological data, followed by experimental validation.
