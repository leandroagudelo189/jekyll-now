#### We are currently in development. We hope to see you back when we are up and running. Enquiries for career prospects, funding and investment opportunities, please refer to [contact@renesence.com](mailto:email@domain.com)
<br />
We believe in the creation of long-term solutions with long-term endeavours. For this reason, renesence labs embrace scientific discovery with research and education. We are an organization whose primary goals are:

# Research

- Existing machine and deep learning models lack allostatic strategies. In addition, current systems offer great performance in narrow environments. This means deep reinforcement learning or evolutionary strategies fail to integrate responses across multiple non-related environments. In fact, there is no viable long-term memory approach for multienvironment integration. Training these systems remains very expensive, even for approaches that mimic natural selection such as genetic algorithms. 

- Develop hybrid deep learning algorithms suitable for understanding complex biological networks and study human disease.

# Education

With the renascence of machine and deep learning, the world is changing at an increasing pace. Given this dynamism and because we believe in a culture of learning and development, we want to curate, document, implement and ameliorate machine and deep learning techniques that can be applied for automated scientific discovery. We firmly believe that this method will improve the process of learning how to learn and the process of finding new solutions to existing problems.

# The Founders
### Leandro Agudelo, PhD
Leandro is a postdoctoral associate at the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.csail.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} in [Manolis Kellis lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/compbio.html){:target="_blank"}. He works at the intersection between metabolism, transcriptional regulation, computational biology and deep learning. His skill-sets are whithin the areas of molecular biology and computer science so he integrates them to understand the deep underlying order within complex biological systems. On the one hand, he applies machine and deep learning algorithms for pattern discovery in biological data, followed by experimental validation. On the other hand, he is insterested in finding ways to emulate strategies from evolutionary molecular adaptations to improve existing machine and deep learning systems.

### Alice Martin
Alice Martin is currently finishing a 3-month intensive training in Data Science where she is applying the latest Machine Learning techniques. In parallel, she is using a deep learning approach to model decision making in Parkinson Disease Progression. Starting from November 2018, she will be a PhD student in Machine Learning at Ecole Polytechnique (Paris) while also working part-time as a Machine Learning Engineer.
Before that, she studied in one of the French top-league engineering schools where she gained hands-on experience in diverse subjects such as advanced mathematics, computer science, physics and business strategy. She later worked as a data analyst for an Aerospace company in California.
Through her past experiences, she has worked in a broad range of scientific fields, and now she wants to focus on the integration of the areas she has loved the most since high-school: Mathematics, Computer Science and Biology.

### Åsa Segerstolpe, PhD
Åsa is a research scientist at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/){:target="_blank"} in [the Klarman Cell Observatory](https://www.broadinstitute.org/klarman-cell-observatory){:target="_blank"}, where she works developing high throughput methods for systems biology. Åsa has extensive experience with single-RNA seq and RNA biology. She is currently interested in understanding complex regulatory circuits in type-1 and type-2 diabetes. Åsa is also involved in the human cell atlas project, where the goal is to map individually all human cells. This will be a step forward towards our understanding of several disease processes.
