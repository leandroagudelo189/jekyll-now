We believe in the creation of long-term solutions with long-term endeavours. For this reason, renesence labs embrace scientific discovery with research and education. We are an organization whose primary goals are:


# Research

Existing machine and deep learning models lack allostatic strategies. In addition, current systems offer great performance in narrow environment or applications. This means deep reinforcement learning or evolutionary strategies fail to integrate responses across multiple non-related environments. In fact, there is no viable long-term memory approach for multi-environment integration. Training these systems remains very expensive, even for approaches that mimic natural selection such as genetic algorithms. Interestingly, biological systems have developed solutions for integrating massive tons of data with encoded responses that can last many generations and can be used in different environments. Among the solutions offering better evolutionary outcomes are comparmentalization of specific tasks, development of low entropy models at quasi equilibrium and transcriptional encoding of information for memory recall. In line with this, we aim at applying our understanding of biological, metabolic and cellular systems to develop machine and deep learning models that mimic long-term transcriptional encoding. We believe this scientific journey would be a step closer to the generation of agents suitable for multi-environment integration.

- Develop allostatic deep learning systems that emulate transcriptional encoding
- Develop low-metric entropy models that pre-process data to increase their redundancy or commonality. We complement this with the use of deep autoencoders or compressive algorithms for reconstitution of learned tasks. 
- Develop deep learning systems that combine reinforcement learning and evolutionary strategies
- Develop hybrid deep learning algorithms for unsupervised tasks
- Develop 3d machine learning environments suitable for visualization and assessment of complex biological data


# Applied Research

- Develop hybrid deep learning algorithms suitable for understanding complex biological networks 


# Education

With the renascence of machine and deep learning, the world is changing at an increasing pace. Given this dynamism and because we believe in a culture of learning and development, we want to curate, document, implement and ameliorate machine and deep learning techniques that can be applied for automated scientific discovery. We firmly believe that this method will improve the process of learning how to learn and help us finding new solutions to existing problems.


# The Founders
### [Leandro Agudelo, PhD]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018-05-04-Leandro-Agudelo)
Leandro is a postdoctoral associate at the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.csail.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} in [Manolis Kellis lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/compbio.html){:target="_blank"}, where he works at the intersection between metabolism, transcriptional regulation, computational biology and deep learning. His skill-sets are whithin the areas of molecular biology and computer science so he integrates them to understand the deep underlying order within complex biological systems. On the one hand, he applies machine and deep learning algorithms for pattern discovery in biological data, followed by experimental validation. On the other hand, he is insterested in emulating strategies from evolutionary molecular adaptations to improve existing machine and deep learning systems.

### [Åsa Segerstolpe, PhD]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018-05-07-Åsa-Segerstolpe)
Åsa is a research scientist at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/){:target="_blank"} in [the Klarman Cell Observatory](https://www.broadinstitute.org/klarman-cell-observatory){:target="_blank"}, where she works developing high throughput methods for systems biology. Åsa has extensive experience with single-RNA seq and RNA biology. She is currently interested in understanding complex regulatory circuits in type-1 and type-2 diabetes. Åsa is also involved in the human cell atlas project, where the goal is to map individually all human cells. This will be a step forward towards our understanding of several disease processes.
