#### We are currently in development. We hope to see you back when we are up and running. Enquiries for career prospects, funding and investment opportunities, please refer to [contact@renesence.com](mailto:email@domain.com)

Given our believe that the creation of long-term solutions entails long-term endeavours, renesence labs embrace scientific discovery with research and education. We are an organization whose primary goals are:


# Research

Existing deep learning models lack allostatic strategies. In addition, current systems offer great performance in narrow environment or applications. This means that deep reinforcement learning or evolutionary strategies fail to integrate responses across multiple non-related environments. In fact, there is no viable long-term memory approach for multi-environment integration. Training these systems remains very expensive, even for approaches that mimic natural selection such as genetic algorithms. Interestingly, biological systems have developed solutions for integrating massive tons of data with encoded responses for several environments that can last many generations. in mainly two ways... low entropy information and transcriptional encoding. Fortunately, our understanding of biological/cellular systems that have evolved long-term memory encoding via genetic transcription makes them suitable for multi-environment integration.

- Develop allostatic deep learning systems that emulate transcriptional encoding
- Develop systems that pre-process data to increase their redundancy. This allows us to use deep autoencoders or compressive algorithm to keep low metric entropy models.
- Develop deep learning systems that combine reinforcement learning and evolutionary strategies
- Develop hybrid deep learning algorithms for unsupervised tasks


# Applied Research

- Develop hybrid deep learning algorithms suitable for understanding complex biological networks 


# Education

With the advent of deep learning, the world is changing at an increasing pace. Given this dynamism and because we believe in a culture of learning and development, we want to curate, document, implement and ameliorate machine and deep learning techniques that can be applied for automated scientific discovery. We firmly believe that this method will not only improve the process of learning how to learn but also help us finding new solutions to existing problems.


# The Founders
### [Leandro Agudelo, PhD]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018-05-04-Leandro-Agudelo)
Leandro is a postdoctoral associate at the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.csail.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} in [Manolis Kellis lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/compbio.html){:target="_blank"}, where he works at the intersection between metabolism, computational biology and deep learning. His skill-sets are whithin the areas of molecular metabolism and computer science. He is endlessly curious about understanding the deep underlying order within complex biological systems. He applies machine and deep learning algorithms for pattern discovery in biological data, followed by experimental validation.

### [Åsa Segerstolpe, PhD]({{ site.baseurl }}/2018-05-07-Åsa-Segerstolpe)
Åsa is a research scientist at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/){:target="_blank"} in [the Klarman Cell Observatory](https://www.broadinstitute.org/klarman-cell-observatory){:target="_blank"}, where she works developing high throughput methods for systems biology. Åsa has extensive experience with single-RNA seq and RNA biology. She is currently interested in understanding complex regulatory circuits in type-1 and type-2 diabetes. Åsa is also involved in the human cell atlas project, where the goal is to map individually all human cells. This will be a step forward towards our understanding of several disease processes.
