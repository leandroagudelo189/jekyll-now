# Leandro Agudelo, PhD

Leandro is a postdoctoral associate at the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.csail.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} in [Manolis Kellis lab](http://compbio.mit.edu/compbio.html){:target="_blank"}. He works at the intersection between metabolism, transcriptional regulation, computational biology and deep learning. His skill-sets are within the areas of molecular biology and computer science so he integrates them to understand the deep underlying order within complex biological systems. On the one hand, he applies machine and deep learning algorithms for pattern discovery in biological data, followed by experimental validation. On the other hand, he is interested in finding ways to emulate strategies from evolutionary molecular adaptations to improve existing machine and deep learning systems.
